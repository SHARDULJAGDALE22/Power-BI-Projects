Hi, I'm a Data Analyst 👋  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I specialize in leveraging Power BI and Python to transform raw data into meaningful business insights. This repository highlights my Power BI project, where I applied analytical and visualization techniques to uncover actionable trends.

## 📊 Project Overview  
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing business performance through interactive dashboards. The goal was to present key performance indicators (KPIs) that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.  

**Key objectives:**  
- Collected, cleaned, and prepared raw data for analysis.  
- Designed automated visual reports for performance tracking.  
- Highlighted business insights through dynamic dashboards.  

## 🧠 Skills & Tools  
- Power BI (Dashboard creation, DAX, Data modeling)  
- Data transformation with Power Query  
- Data analysis and visualization techniques  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data preprocessing  

## 📈 Insights & Results  
- Identified top-performing segments and growth areas.  
- Created interactive reports with real-time filtering.  
- Enhanced decision-making with KPI-based analysis.  

## 🚀 Future Scope  
I plan to expand this project by integrating data pipelines and connecting Power BI to live data sources for real-time analytics.
